🚀 Successfully Completed Task: Setting Up a CI Pipeline using GitHub Actions 🚀

I recently worked on implementing a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for a sample Python application to strengthen my DevOps skills and gain hands-on experience in automating build processes.
This project focuses on building the application automatically whenever new code is pushed to the repository — ensuring code quality, faster feedback, and efficient development workflows.

🔧 Tech & Tools Used

Programming Language: Python

Version Control: Git & GitHub

CI Tool: GitHub Actions

Testing Framework: pytest

📌 Project Highlights

🔹 Created a simple Python application and added unit tests
🔹 Hosted code in a GitHub repository
🔹 Integrated GitHub Actions to automatically run build & test workflows on each git push
🔹 Implemented workflow triggers for both push and pull requests
🔹 Successfully validated pipeline execution through automated test runs

🏁 Outcome

Every time new code is pushed to the repository, the pipeline:
1️⃣ Checks out the latest code
2️⃣ Installs dependencies
3️⃣ Runs automated tests
4️⃣ Provides real-time build status & feedback

This project strengthened my understanding of:

CI/CD concepts

GitHub Actions workflow structure

Automated testing & pipeline reliability

DevOps best practices
